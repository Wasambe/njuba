In the words of Aidah
<br>
This is a very big platform for not only our children who have got an opportunity to study and to us 
the parents who have been given a very big helping hand but also to our late mother who passed away 
in such an unexpected manner. She was a great grandmother who loved her grandkids and always made sure 
they were well and attended school and would always go an extra mile to pay their school dues.
When she passed,we were so worried about their studies but thanks to this scholarship,they have not 
lacked.We pray for the hands that provide to continuously be blessed.lt is because of this scholarship 
that the grandkids have not been scattered around but continue to stay together.As the saying goes 
"At the end of the tunnel,is light" so we thought with grandmother gone it was the end.But through the 
scholarship we have seen the light.May the souls of the late Ruth Wilson and the late Deborah Lugyawo 
Njuba our beloved parents continue resting in peace for through them we unite.
